This project is in response to several requests from DDW users that the learning curve of that system was a bit steep. So in the Docker version of DDW we take a more modular and turn-key approach. There is one Docker (ddw-docker-dbase) that hosts the main Postgresql dbase that the DDW gatways will send their results to. There will be another companion Docker (ddw-docker-gway) that will bundle MIRTH as a service, pointing its results to ddw-dbase. 

Herein lies the following ddw-dbase components
a) Dockerfile 		(the main build file for the docker)
b) purged-ddw.sql 	(the ddw schema)
c) service-start.sh (for provisioning the docker)
d) run_ddw_db.sh	(a convenience script for automating the build/run/provision cycle)
e) docker.cheats 	(quick notes for the Docker novice)
f) this README
